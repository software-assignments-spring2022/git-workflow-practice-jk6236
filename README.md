## Description

Spotify is a music/podcast listening platform that was created back in 2006. It has become a lot more advanced since then while maintaining is user-friendly interface. Spotify can be used on a number of devices whether it is running IOS/Android for mobile or Windows/MacOS for Desktops and laptops. I am able to consistently use it daily without the music stopping or pausing by itself.I am a audiophile myself so using a site/application that will guarentee high quality music is worth the monthly payments. However, even without the monthly payments it is easy to use and the ads only appear every 30 minutes which estimates to be around 10 songs.

Some extra features that I enjoy about Spotify is that it has a variety of different categories and it even creates one for you based on the music that you listen to. In addition to this, this software also allows for people to create their own personalized playlists and it is also unlimited. This not only lets people have a playlist for any situation but also lets the user share the music/podcasts they enjoy to friends and family.
